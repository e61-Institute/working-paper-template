### References lists

LaTeX uses `.bib` files to store references (see [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Using_bibliographies_on_Overleaf) for more). These can be prepared manually, but why do things manually when you could automate them. 

If you like, we have access to [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-manager/library/all-references/), which is a reference manager. It is very good. Your Mendeley reference library can then be automatically synced with your Overleaf references for a particular document by following the instructions [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_to_link_your_Overleaf_account_to_Mendeley_and_Zotero).
